Tales from the Funhouse

**About**

A quirky text adventure game, inspired by all the classic LucasArts, and Sierra adventure games - minus the graphics. My first attempt at any "serious" programming. The code is bloated, and sloppy, but I'll work on optimizing it. Just trying to get it working first. At the moment the basic program works, but there isn't much content.
