My name is Alex, and I have very little programming experience (a little HTML, and CSS), and it probably shows in my programming, but I don't really care. This repo contains all of the crappy little programs that I have written for ComputerCraft, which is a Minecraft mod that adds computers to Minecraft.

Pretty self explanatory. A simple program that pulls words from some tables, and inserts them into a short, pre-written story. Plan to modify it to use user input words, and to piece a story together using sentence fragments in tables.

A very simple program that checks the time every so often, and turns on/off any Redstone Lamps connected to the computer, depending on the time.

As the name implies, this was my first attempt at writing a little calculator program. It only add, subtracts, multiplies, and divides, and only 2 numbers at a time, but cut me some slack. Was not only the first calculator I tried to program, but also my first program in LUA at all.

An overly ambitious little project. It's basically a little sequencer for Minecraft, using Note Blocks, and computers. Songs are stored in tables, in separate song files. Needs a lot of work, and is probably way over my head. The current version sort of works though.
